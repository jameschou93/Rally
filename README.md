# RALLY

Rally is my answer to the issue of finding a meetup spot/venue to meet with your teammates, friends, and colleagues. The app allows users to join or create groups, setup appointments and events, and find a location to meet up in real-time by viewing a map with all events occuring on the same date appearing as a 'rally-point'.

The group directory allows users to find groups related to their own interests or professional backgrounds based on keyword searches and categories

The Meetup Radar allows users to see other meet ups taking place on the same day. Don't want to meet in a spot that's too crowded? Look for an area on the map with less markers!
