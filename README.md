# RALLY

Rally is my answer to the issue of finding a meetup spot/venue to meet with your teammates, friends, and colleagues. The app allows users to join or create groups, setup appointments and events, and find a location to meet up in real-time by viewing a map with all events occuring on the same date appearing as a 'rally-point'.
